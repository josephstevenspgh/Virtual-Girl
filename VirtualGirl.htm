		<h3>Background</h3><br>
		This game was made within 48 hours for <a href=http://www.ludumdare.com>Ludum Dare 21</a>. This was my second 48-hour game, and was a lot of fun to make. Of course, I didn't get to make it as good as I wanted to, but I still really enjoyed the process. As always, it feels great to finish something.
